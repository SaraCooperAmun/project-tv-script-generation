# project-tv-script-generation

TV script generation using RNN following Udacity's Deep Learning Course (Lesson 4 of Recurrent Neural Networks).

In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.
